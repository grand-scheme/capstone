# **The Project**
Name: [_TBD_]\
\
Overview:\
This is my capstone project for my time at Epicodus, and is currently a work in progress. Development began on February 26th; its official presentation date will be March 11th. This README file will be updated to include download and use information once the project is in a fit state to be accessed.\
\
Project Description:\
Mobile-focused app for the user's private reviews and ratings of the restaurants they go to.\
\
The non-standard rating system and lack of worldwide publication will encourage the user to be more honest and to provide their future self with better guidance in their future dine-out experiences.\
\
The ability to allow a user to add multiple reviews to a single restaurant will allow them to keep track of what items they have tried and enjoyed, whether one location is better than another, or keep track of which serving staff members deserve to be avoided.\
