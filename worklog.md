~9am: troubleshoot create-react-app, install latest version

10:11: Search up some diagramming tools for overall project layout; trying out proto.io, hotgloo, fluid.io...

11:05: Gave up on most of these; their exceedingly modern canvas design is as slow as cow-drawn train car. No thank you. 

12:02: designing Site Views/Screens. Finished skeleton of Home and Registration. 

12:30: Correction, _now_ the home and registration are finished.

2:06: Just coming back after stepping away for ~20 minutes due to FIRE ALARM. Still working on 'Restaurant' landing page design.

2:42: Thought, "I'm going to need the user to be able to type in a restaurant name, but auto-complete if it's one they've been to before. How does that work?"
Found [JS tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp).

3:30: Working on "Add New" view diagram; looking up how to make a hexagonal shape in js. (Maybe 'how to put an element every 60Â° around a circle' ?)
Reference to look at later: [red blob shapes](https://www.redblobgames.com/)

4:20: Found tutorial for circle icons... nice. [Thanks SOF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12813573/position-icons-into-circle).

4:45: Still chipping away at visual for 'add new review'.

5:14: Actually push that commit.
