~9am: troubleshoot create-react-app, install latest version

10:11: Search up some diagramming tools for overall project layout; trying out proto.io, hotgloo, fluid.io...

11:05: Gave up on most of these; their exceedingly modern canvas design is as slow as cow-drawn train car. No thank you. 

12:02: designing Site Views/Screens. Finished skeleton of Home and Registration. 

12:30: Correction, _now_ the home and registration are finished.

2:06: Just coming back after stepping away for ~20 minutes due to FIRE ALARM. Still working on 'Restaurant' landing page design.
